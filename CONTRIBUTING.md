### Something like to do here:
  Right now I'm rewriting all project to make it use database to store the data, so:
    
    1. The database is made (very simple one)
    2. Commands are needed to be rewritten, because of data storing changes.
    3. All the not working stuff needs to be fixed (Probably player commands)
    4. To do but for me: write some unit tests
